Homework 1

I had a good time looking through all of the code and figuring out how everything worked. Still not quite there
yet, but it was alot of fun. I struggled with the 2nd bonus challenge. I made a get request from the correct url,
but I kept getting a 'circular object cannot be converted to JSON warning' which was really frustrating. I tried
to stringify it, but it just returned [Object Object] in the response. I couldn't figure out how it was initially
sent if it was not JSON. It will be good to ask :)
